Builds and Deployments have a tough time when it comes to PowerShell verbs.

From https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428(v=vs.85).aspx

----

Publish (pb)
Makes a resource available to others. This verb is paired with Unpublish.
For this action, do not use verbs such as Deploy, Release, or Install.

----

We could potentially use "New":

----

New (n)
Creates a resource. (The Set verb can also be used when creating a resource that includes data, such as the Set-Variable cmdlet.)
For this action, do not use verbs such as Create, Generate, Build, Make, or Allocate.

----

Install (is)
Places a resource in a location, and optionally initializes it. This verb is paired with Uninstall.
For this action, do not a use verb such as Setup.

----

But when we roll-back/revert/restore, we aren't really "uninstalling" when we talk about a website:

----

Uninstall (us)
Removes a resource from an indicated location. This verb is paired with Install.

----

Restore (rr)
Sets a resource to a predefined state, such as a state set by Checkpoint. For example, the Restore-Computer cmdlet starts a system restore on the local computer.
For this action, do not use verbs such as Repair, Return, Undo, or Fix.

----

At least Backups are easy:

----

Backup (ba)
Stores data by replicating it.
For this action, do not use verbs such as Save, Burn, Replicate, or Sync.
